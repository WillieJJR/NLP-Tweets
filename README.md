# NLP-Tweets
The goal of this project is to analyze a subset of President Trump's tweets over the course of 2020 (July - November) to identify 3 things: 

Part 1: Topic Modeling - I want to better understand the over-arching Topics of President Trumps tweets by understanding the Presidents word patterns

Part 2: Opinion Mining - I want to better understand the tone of the words President Trump has used in his tweets

Part 3: Entity Recognition - I want to understand the most important person, place, and organizations President Trump referenced in his tweets
